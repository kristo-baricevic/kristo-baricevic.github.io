               <p>The Strange Places were my most recent and my favorite band. I wrote all 
               of the songs, sang lead vocals and played lead guitar. This band existed
               from 2015-2017 and went on several Midwest tours. RIP Infinity is my 
               contribution to the psychedilic soundscape of American music. I also did
               the graphic design.

               <p>Many of the songs in RIP Infinity started off here, in HAppY CaMP, a lo-fi
               bedroom collection of songs I wrote while living, breathing, and traveling
               around Earth in my twenties. A lof of these songs have to do with death,
               loss, and subsequent resurrection. I played all instruments and made the 
               artwork.

               <p>On occasion I get to travel around playing piano for musicians like Patrick
               Haggerty, the first gay singer in Country Music. Patrick Released the self-titled
               Lavender Country album in 1973, a pro-Queer masterpiece that lived in
               obscurity until it's re-release in 2014. Since then, Patrick has enjoyed
               a resurgance and I was recruited, among many others, to bring the Lavender
               Country music to a modern setting.

               <p>Old Scratch's Burnpile is a collaboration with my friend Nicky Z. It's 
                  kind of like the Muppets gone country, but it's a little twisted and irreverent. We like
                  to explore the fringes of country music and desecrate the mountain of legends
                  that brought us here. But not in a bad way!

                  <p>These were the b-sides to HAppY CaMP, but I didn't want to perform them so I made
                  up an alter ego, Paisley Estrange, who was a lounge singer in a ghost town. I played 
                  all of the instruments except for a few drum tracks which feature one of my favorite drummers!
                  I also did the graphic design, which is an outfit purchased en route to a concert by the Rebel,
                  laid out upon a blanket I rescued from the thrift bins. I believe this is be what Paisley Estrange
                  wore while he worked his empty lounges.

                  her. We worked up some demos and arrangements with my band at the time, the Strange 
                  Places, and came up with this really cool collection of songs. I consider this to be a 
                  companion piece to the Strange Places full length album, RIP Infinity,

                  Tortuga is a supergroup of sorts that features the songs of Mike Leahy. I think at one 
                  point we might have had 9 or 10 people on stage for live performances of this band,
                  but in the studio we were really able to hone in on the atmospheric elements created by
                  pedal steel and other auxilary instruments. It gives off an alternative spaghetti western

                  Jenny is a killer singer and a great songwriter. I had a lot of fun producing and 
                  arranging these songs, as many of them were brought to me at the demo stage. I love
                  to fill songs out and think of different musicians that can really give the words life 
                  and meaning. This project is a great example of that!

                  <p>
                     <i>The Bum Trip</i> is a travelogue comic book that tells the tale of a curious fugitive 
                     who travels by thumb and communes with spirits they do not fully understand. Although highly
                     fictional this was inspired by my own hitchhiking adventures in my early twenties.

                        <article>While working in music production and management, I often found myself writing copy for an artist's press kit.
                           Artist bios, album one-sheets, and other types of copy became a regular task. I also developed an extensive business
                           plan in order to raise capital, which is sampled here.
